# What is GenevaERS?  
## (in less than 140 words)

GenevaERS fixes log jams in your computer processing.

For example, a customer program took **25 hours** to run.

GenevaERS did it in **less than one hour** - on the same data on the same computer producing the same results. 

How is that possible?

Reads from disk are 1000 times slower than calculations.  Too many reads waste time.

Example: a product file has 1,000 records and a sales file has a million records.  A report program reads the product file for each sales transaction.  

That means the report reads the product file **a million times**.

GenevaERS reads the product file just **1,000 times**.  GenevaERS is fast because it saves 999,000 reads.

You could fix this by rewriting your programs.

GenevaERS is free and does the programming for you.  

A paid version is even faster using special features.
