## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting Issues

To report a problem, you can open an issue in repository against a specific workflow.

If the issue is sensitive in nature or a security related issue,
please do not report in the issue tracker but instead email genevaers-private@lists.openmainframeproject.org.

We will track individual issues via issues tab on the affected repo

The project will acknowledge a majority of bug reports submitted in the last 2-12 months (inclusive)

The project's initial response time for any vulnerability report received in the last 6 months will be less than or equal to 14 days
