/**
 * This class represents a list of SAFRPersistentObjects. This is an extension
 * of java.util.ArrayList&gt;T&lt; so it supports the interface java.util.List&gt;T&lt;.
 * Instances of this class are created by substituting template symbol 'T' with
 * a subtype of SAFRPersistentObject. The class overrides the behaviour of
 * certain List methods with behaviour required for managing lists of persistent
 * objects within the SAFR application. For example, if such an object is to be
 * removed from a list, it should also be deleted from the database, so this
 * class overrides the behaviour of List&gt;T&lt;.remove to mark an object that is
 * already persistent for deletion, rather than physically removing it from the
 * list. This is necessary to that the data layer can erase the objects
 * persistent state when the object is stored.
